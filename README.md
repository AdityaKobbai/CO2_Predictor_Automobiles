## CO2_EMISSIONS_PREDICTOR_FROM_AUTOMOBILES

"The objective of this project is to analyze the predominant environmental pollutant, CO2, and explore its underlying causes and sources. Additionally, I aim to develop a robust machine- learning model to assist stakeholders in mitigating its impact. My focus lies in creating a predictive model that empowers automobile designers to forecast CO2 emissions resulting from feature modifications. Furthermore, I aim to provide consumers with insights into the environmental consequences of their vehicle choices."
